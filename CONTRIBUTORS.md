The idea for a global view
of the [Recurse Center's](https://www.recurse.com/) network
was raised
at a group discussion
on building community software
during the RC annual alumni reunion,
Never Graduate Week 2019.
[Jaryn Colbert](https://github.com/jaryncolbert)
completed the first iteration of the world map
in her Summer 1 '19 batch shortly thereafter.

The initial codebase
was based on
[Jason Owen's](https://github.com/jasonaowen)
[Recurse Faces App](https://faces.recurse.com),
which made building the first prototype much easier.

Here is an inevitably incomplete list
of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS --
people who have submitted patches,
reported bugs,
provided feature ideas,
helped answer questions,
participated in code reviews, and
generally made the app much, much better
(listed alphabetically by first name):
